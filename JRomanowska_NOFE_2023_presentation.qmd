## Take-home message

![](img/visual_abstract_transparent.png)

::: notes
Use of certain drugs can change risk of developing PD even up to 10 years after
taking this drug.
:::

## How did we come to this conclusion? {.center}

::: incremental
- Norwegian Prescription Database
- hypothesis-free screening    
_(Cox regression)_
- ATC-code level 2    
_(C09 = agents acting on renin-angiotensin system)_
:::

::: notes
- NorPD: entire dataset, more than 600 million prescriptions from ca.4.5 million
Norwegians, in the period 2004-2019
- Cox regression with time-dependent exposure and age as time scale, adjusted for
sex and education (as a proxy for socio-economic status)
- grouping the drugs

::: notes
- PD is a slow-developing disease with various symptoms appearing in a random
sequence over 10 or more years before the final diagnosis can be set
- some drugs can be taken sporadically, some need to be taken longer, some
people take a smaller dose of a drug, some take larger - how to account for that?

SOLUTIONS:

- time-lag analyses
- dose-response analyses

:::

::: notes
We have conducted several sensitivity analyses, most importantly:

- _time-lag analyses_, where the exposure period was shortened for everyone by
3, 5, 8, or 10 years
- _dose-response analyses_, where the exposure was modeled as a categorical
variable with quartiles of the number of prescriptions taken

## Drug classes retaining the effect throughout time and doses



## Conclusion

::: callout-tip
## drug classes `r fa("arrow-up")` PD-risk    
help identify patients early
:::

. . .

::: callout-tip
## drug classes `r fa("arrow-down")` PD-risk    
might be repurposed as new treatment
